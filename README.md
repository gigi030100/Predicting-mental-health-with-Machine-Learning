# Predicting-mental-health-with-Machine-Learning
My project aims to utilise machine learning techniques to identify early adolescents at high-risk of mental disorders during late adolescence. It will specifically focus on how well the combined effects of different facets of familial characteristics at the age of 14 can identify high risk cohort members at the age of 17.
