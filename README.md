# Predicting-mental-health-with-Machine-Learning
My project aims to utilise machine learning techniques to identify early adolescents at high-risk of mental disorders during late adolescence. It will specifically focus on how well the combined effects of different facets of familial characteristics at the age of 14 can identify high risk cohort members at the age of 17.

# Methodology

## Dataset
The Millenium Cohort Study was used (URL: https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=2000031) which contains longitudinal data from age 14 to 17.

### Predictor variables at the age of 14
1. Parent-reported Kessler Psychological Distress Scale.
   6-item measure aims to capture non-specific psychological distress as a form of indication for mental illness among the general population using a scale of 1-5 to measure parental mental illness.
